# 🧠 Multi-Agent Historical Intelligence System
AI Multi-Agent System for Foreign Monarchy Historical Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a Multi-Agent Artificial Intelligence System designed to analyze and generate historical knowledge related to foreign monarchies and global historical events.

The system applies modern AI agent orchestration concepts using a Parent Agent + Sub-Agent Architecture.
Each agent is responsible for specific cognitive tasks such as query understanding, historical data retrieval, and narrative generation.

This project demonstrates real-world applications of:

Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)

Distributed AI Reasoning

Tool-Augmented LLM Agents

Historical Knowledge Synthesis

## 🎯 Objectives

Develop a scalable AI Multi-Agent architecture

Demonstrate agent collaboration and workflow orchestration

Apply AI to historical domain knowledge

Build production-style AI system structure

Deploy using Google Cloud compatible environment

## 🏗 System Architecture

Final Historical Narrative Output

## 🧩 Agent Roles
## 🧭 Parent Agent

Responsible for:

Query interpretation

Task decomposition

Agent orchestration

Iteration control

## 📚 Historical Research Sub-Agent

Responsible for:

Searching historical knowledge

Extracting key facts

Structuring historical timeline

## 📝 Report Generator Sub-Agent

Responsible for:

Transforming data into readable narrative

Generating structured historical reports

Ensuring language quality

🚀 Installation
1️⃣ Clone Repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd your-project

## 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 3️⃣ Setup Environment Variables

Create .env file inside agent folders:

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
PROJECT_ID=your_project_id

▶ Running the System

Run Parent Agent:

python parent_and_subagents/agent.py


Run Workflow Agent:

python workflow_agents/agent.py

## 🔁 Agent Iteration Control

The system uses controlled agent iteration:

max_iterations = 3


This prevents infinite agent loops while maintaining reasoning depth.

## 📊 Key AI Concepts Demonstrated

Multi-Agent Coordination

Tool-Augmented LLM Reasoning

Hierarchical Agent Control

AI Workflow Orchestration

Iterative Reasoning Loops

Prompt-Driven Task Execution

##🧪 Example Query
Tell me about a foreign queen and her historical impact.


Output:

Historical background

Timeline events

Political impact

Historical legacy

## 📈 Future Improvements

Add Vector Database Memory

Add Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Add Web Search Tool Integration

Deploy as API Service

Add Frontend Dashboard

## 🔬 Research Value

This project demonstrates practical implementation of:

Distributed AI Systems

Autonomous Agent Collaboration

Knowledge-Oriented LLM Systems

AI Historical Reasoning Models
